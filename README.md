# Life Expectancy Prediction Exploration Using Neural Networks

This mini project incorporates various factors other than traditional demographic information to train a neural network to predict life expectancies. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- `Python`
- `TensorFlow/Keras`
- `Pandas`
- `Scikit-learn`

## üìò What I Have Learned

### Data is Key
- **Data Preprocessing**: One of the first lessons was the importance of clean and meaningful data. Working with Pandas, I employed techniques for data cleaning and transformation, which are crucial for training a reliable model.
- **Dataset Analysis**: Understanding the dataset was vital. It helped me recognize patterns, anomalies, and the significance of different features in predicting life expectancy.

### Machine Learning
- **Model Selection**: Experimenting with different models using TensorFlow/Keras and Scikit-learn was interesting to see how both libraries equip the everyday user with powerful models to explore machine learning.
- **Model Tuning**: This process highlighted the delicate balance between model complexity, overfitting, and underfitting.

## üí° Improvements
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate more diverse features and data to improve the model's accuracy and predictability.
- **Further Tunining of Hyperparameters**: Further experimentation of hyperparameters used during the model building process can be explored.
- **Data Analysis**: More thorough data analysis of the results can be done to derive more insights.
